# Github tutorial on Github
As a green hand in github, I know how to use git to manage my code. However, I don't get how to use this in the real cases. So, I write the markdown file in the repository to record how I learn to use this fantastic tool.

## What's Github
At first, what would you prefer, "on", "in", or "at" github? The answer should be "on". Here is the [answer](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/89101/in-on-or-at-github).

Ok, let's go back to the topic. Here are some definitions of the items about github.

**Repository**: It is just like a project, you can save your codes about one project in the same repository.

**Star**: You star a project means you like the project and put into your "favorite" folder.

**Fork**: Copy the project to your own account. The edits on the forked repository will not be changed unless you send a request to the owner and the owner accepts.

**Pull request**: When you want to upload your code to the owner of the repository, you can pull request to the owner. When the request is accepted, the edits you make will be shown on the original repository.
